I am Srinivasan customer who is using your brand mobile phone model (Micromax Bolt D321 blue) since 18/04/2015. IMEI no is 911418351683315. During this period i was facing a issue in charging and i went to the Micromax authorized service center Micromax care Mobi Vision located in Kodambakkam High road, T. Nagar, Chennai on Feb/17/2016. 
They told us there is a problem with a charging pin it need to be replaced. We accept to replace the pin. Then we went back on Feb/19/2016 to collect the mobile phone. They checked the in front of me with the battery and it is not working. The we left our mobile there itself over there and after one week i went over your authorized service center they told us there is a problem with board it need to be replaced and it will take one month. On March/16/16 i went over the service center to collect the mobile phone they charged us 800 Rs for the replaced charging pin  and will not issue the mobile phone if the payment is not made. So i made payment and collected my mobile phone.
As it is very clear that the problem with board caused the charging issue and the mobile phone is also under the warranty it need to be replaced or serviced freely.
The service engineer has not examined the problem properly and made me to visit the service center more than four times without proper response.
It is clear that problem with your service center.
I need the proper explanation for the inconvenience caused for me and the money i spent unnecessarily.
I have attached the copy of the bill they have collected below for your Kind attention.

Thank you

Srinivasan

I was a genuine customer of Micromax using  Micromax Canvas 4 (A210) and my screen broke so I went to ""Certified Micromax Service Center"" based in Akurdi Pune. 

My phone was working properly except broken screen but they forced me to pay for so called ""Checking Charges"" 50/- Rs. also, without receipt and when I asked for receipt the cashier took 56/- Rs. and directly told me, we don't provide receipt because we want to save tax.(They take money from people and don't provide receipt)

If its seen that only screen is broken and display also working properly then WHY CHECKING CHARGES TOOK FROM ME?I know how to repair mobile 

Please take action otherwise I will go to consumer forum.

so i contact their customer care and they told they will replace the product and give  with in 10 days,

i waited for almost 15 days and after that i called them, they told me delivery is not available in ur location, (im staying in the heart of the city ) and they told they can deliver the product in 7 days to the nearest service center, again i waited for almost 10 days called then again, they told please give ur old product (3 week used) to them and they will replace it, did the same and from the service center they told that they wont accept the product,

somehow they accepted the product due to our request and told u will be responsible they wont follow up,

and now my product is there in service center for more than 6 months still while calling the customer care they are singing the same song 7 days else 10 days else 15 days,

i hope after some days they will tell please forget about the product,

and now they have started a new technique, they will provide a link . just follow the link for ur complaints and will solve the issue soon, i registerd the link 2 months before and no reponse till now,

the worst customer support and the worst product i used in my enter life,

i think cheap 50 rupees road side products is better than their things.

and even they consider their customers like beggers

any way im going to file a case against micromax as well as the customer care exicutives, because i think staff sitting there dont know how to use computer also itseems, when ever i made a call to the customer care they are telling different differnt things

really a worst attitude and disgusting service

i do have all the records for proceeding a case for cheating 

SO GUYS DONT JUMP INSIDE A PIT HOLE SEEING THE FAKE ADVERTISMENTS AS WELL AS SERVICE ,

JUST BUY MICROMAX PHONE OR THINGS AS USE AND THROW LIKE A PAPER CUP,.

ONE DAY U CAN USE AND NEXT DAY IT WONT WORK,

IF U USE MICROMAX JUST KEEP A NOKIA 1100 SIDE AS BACKUP, WHO KNOW MICROMAX WILL STOP  WORKING

NOTE : NEVER EVER SAVE ANY IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN THAT ALSO.

I LOST ALL MY PERSONAL DATA. EVERYING  FROM THIER GREAT PRODUCT,

ITS BETTER TO BEG THAN CHEATING PEOPLE LIKE THIS'

My complaint number is: AN210216721075.

And i am being claimed that Engineer tried to call me on my mobile number and line was always busy. Seriously, I am really interested to know how come every time an engineer comes to our locality and calls me, my number says busy?

The phone started giving trouble the moment i bought it. I had to go to the service centre to resolve the matter. Customer care suggested to replace it from the store as only 3days were passed and I did as he said. I got a brand new replcement of the same model and it was working well but not for so long. After a month or so some incorrigible problem had been arised as the mic of the phone was not working. I went to the service centre they immediately repair it and returned. On the next day the same problem had returned alongwith some other problems such as no vibration no speaker problem in charging etc. I again weent to service centre and they immediately receive it and told me that it will take atleast 5-7 days to repair. But they gave me call after 1day to receive my phone, whenever i check i found nothing had been resolved. They said they had to send it to HO. It was a incident of  Nov2015 and till date they fail to return my phone. Whenever i tried to follow up they said it will take 15 more days. I got the same reply from the HO as well the best they can do is giving me a complaint no twice a time. So friends please beware of buying any micromax product further..",,status,,2016-03-11 02:39:49,3,2,0

120735417936636_900608323395717,"Sir/maa'am
I am repeatedly writing to you about the poor after sale service I am getting from Micromax and have tried to contact you several times.
Now let me start from beginning once again.
I had purchased Micromax A300 (canvas gold) on 23DEC 2014 and due to sum problem I submitted the phone to Rapid communication on 4th DEC 2015. On 26dec2015 I visited the service center and inquire about the phone an the told me to wait for another 20 days as your phone is not repaired yet and it may be possible that you get a replacement.
In 9th Jan 2016 I received a phone call from Mr Rohit (of Rapid communication) ( mobile no- 08375910118) and told me to wait for next week. After that a called him several time to inquire about the phone but each time he ask for some more time.
Meanwhile I also called to Micromax care and the have given 15 days time each and every time(even after the expiry of first 15days). I also compianed on 26dec2015 with complaint no. MMX2612152063803 and was assured that your complained will be solved in 15 days. (Which is not solved till now). And 3 times I have been assured of call from seniors but never received any call.
Now after so many calls I decided to visit Rapid communication (service center) and went there on 1Feb2016 to find there is no service center any more and there is no representative of the service center also. After inquiring from people there u received a mobile number (08745875629)and I called on that number and talked about my problem. After a brief discussion they said that my phone is under replacement and you will receive phone by 8th Feb 2016. On same day I also wright down my complaint on http://micare.micromaxinfo.com with complaint number as SER145432983131. On 2Feb 2016 I received a call from +911243320100 and we had a discussion about whole issue. To my surprise he also didn't know about the closing of service center and when I told him of this he assure me that our Delhi office will call you and your problem will be sorted out. Again I didn't received phone call from your Delhi office and after waiting till saturdy I again called at 08745875629 and was shocked by the reply from other side. They said me to wait again for 15 days as company is showing status for my phone as under process. 

Now I received a phone on 20/02/2016 from 01244310200 and someone confirmed that mine phone is under replacement and will be replaced in 10 days. Which is again a false statement as 10 days already have been passed.
Now Miss Swati assured me on 8/3/2016 that she will provide me the solution but she didn't called me back

You people really don't want to slve the problems and just passing out the time..

Being a proud Indian, I went for Indian produced Mobile against lot opposition from my relatives and friends.
To my utter dismay, the particular phone  has posed lot of problems on operational matter.
I use this phone only for receiving and out going calls, SMS and whatsapp. Other than this I don't use this phone for other purposes.. 
I am 68 years old. I get messages for installing softwares like Porn club,,Love beauty and other obscene subjects. Already such two softwares are installed in the phone on their own without my knowledge. On top of that I don't know
how to install these softwares. Now the phone is stuck.
I am totally fed up.
If Micromax has any responsible Executives, who can solve this problem? Kindly reply.

I am repeatedly writing to you about the poor after sale service I am getting from Micromax and have tried to contact you several times.
Now let me start from beginning once again.
I had purchased Micromax A300 (canvas gold) on 23DEC 2014 and due to sum problem I submitted the phone to Rapid communication on 4th DEC 2015. On 26dec2015 I visited the service center and inquire about the phone an the told me to wait for another 20 days as your phone is not repaired yet and it may be possible that you get a replacement.
In 9th Jan 2016 I received a phone call from Mr Rohit (of Rapid communication) ( mobile no- 08375910118) and told me to wait for next week. After that a called him several time to inquire about the phone but each time he ask for some more time.
Meanwhile I also called to Micromax care and the have given 15 days time each and every time(even after the expiry of first 15days). I also compianed on 26dec2015 with complaint no. MMX2612152063803 and was assured that your complained will be solved in 15 days. (Which is not solved till now). And 3 times I have been assured of call from seniors but never received any call.
Now after so many calls I decided to visit Rapid communication (service center) and went there on 1Feb2016 to find there is no service center any more and there is no representative of the service center also. After inquiring from people there u received a mobile number (08745875629)and I called on that number and talked about my problem. After a brief discussion they said that my phone is under replacement and you will receive phone by 8th Feb 2016. On same day I also wright down my complaint on http://micare.micromaxinfo.com with complaint number as SER145432983131. On 2Feb 2016 I received a call from +911243320100 and we had a discussion about whole issue. To my surprise he also didn't know about the closing of service center and when I told him of this he assure me that our Delhi office will call you and your problem will be sorted out. Again I didn't received phone call from your Delhi office and after waiting till saturdy I again called at 08745875629 and was shocked by the reply from other side. They said me to wait again for 15 days as company is showing status for my phone as under process. 

Now I received a phone on 20/02/2016 from 01244310200 and someone confirmed that mine phone is under replacement and will be replaced in 10 days. Which is again a false statement as 10 days already have been passed.

Please provide me the exact status of my phone and let me know whether you people will be able to do the required jobjob or not.
